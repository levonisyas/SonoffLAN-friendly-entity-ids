# Sonoff LAN Friendly Entity IDs (fork of AlexxIT/SonoffLAN)

>This is a fork of the original [AlexxIT/SonoffLAN](https://github.com/AlexxIT/SonoffLAN) integration.

The purpose of this fork is to improve entity_id readability in Home Assistant by adding the device friendly name into the generated entity IDs.

>**This fork does not modify unique_id values. Existing installations remain unaffected.**
>**This fork replaces the original SonoffLAN integration and cannot be installed side-by-side.**

## ✨ What This Fork Changes

The original SonoffLAN integration creates entity IDs using only the device ID:

- `switch.sonoff_1000xxxx_1`

With many devices, this becomes difficult to manage.

This fork generates entity IDs that include the user-defined device name from the eWeLink/Sonoff app:

- `switch.sonoff_salon_lamba_1000xxxx_1`

---

## ✅ Features

- Friendly and readable entity IDs
- Multi-channel device support (`_1`, `_2`, `_3`, `_4`)
- Turkish character support (ı, İ, ğ, ş, ç, ö, ü)
- Works across all entity types:
  - switch, sensor, light, cover, climate, remote, binary_sensor
- Backward compatible:
  - Existing installations are not renamed automatically
  - New installations and newly added devices use the new format
